## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **solution-driven analytics framework** to uncover demographic gaps, regional disparities, and systemic inefficiencies within the Aadhaar ecosystem.

Using approximately **900,000 anonymized Aadhaar records**, the system performs **multi-level analysis (National → State → District → Pincode)** to generate actionable insights for digital governance and inclusion-oriented policymaking.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Despite wide Aadhaar adoption, enrollment and biometric update patterns reveal uneven participation across demographics and regions.  
This project focuses on identifying and quantifying:

- Demographic imbalance between minors (5–17) and adults (18+)
- Regional disparity masked by state-level aggregation
- Structural inefficiencies in enrollment and update workflows

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Level Analytics Pipeline**  
  National, state, district, and pincode-level analysis across demographic, biometric, and enrollment datasets.

- **Risk Classification System**  
  Automated categorization of regions into *Healthy, Weak Youth Inclusion, Legacy Gap,* and *Critical* zones.

- **Batch Statistical Engine**  
  Execution of standardized statistical metrics for consistent regional reporting.

- **Query-Driven Analysis Modules**  
  Dedicated question files enabling reusable, scenario-based analytics.
